## About Me
My name is Daphne Oh, I grew up in Southern California. I lived about 45 minutes from L.A. I am currently in my 4th year at UH I chose computer science because my father is a computer programmer and told me they need more women in that field. He has worked for CountryWide, Bank of America, and is currently working for Panda Express at their corporate office. 

## Why MIS
In my computer science courses I got intimmidated and fell behind my other experienced classmates. I wanted to go into web design, but UH only had one class dedicated to that. When I told my father I was discourgaed and not as determined to learn as my classmates, he suggested I look into management because I had already taken so many computer science courses. All of the computer science courses I have previously taken were back end coding. I am excited to learn more about front end coding and get familiar with managment.
