## WOD 1

### BrowserHistory 1
Browser History 1 seemed very overwhelming. Luckily, we did similar coding in class with Lab 1 and 2. When it got to creating links, I had to look back at the HTML for links in the reading material. Following that code helped and having that page open to refer and look back at was really helpful in the beginning. The table of contents I looked up on the HTML beginner's tutorial to see how to set hyperlinks to different sections of the page. That webpage helped me a lot. And it also had the code for adding images with links. This took a lot of work and being timed did not help. I got very stressed and unsure of myself because I knew there was a time limit. I ended up not needing the full 25 minutes and could finish the webpage. 

### BrowserHistory 2
To start Browser History 2, I went through the list of instructions without timing myself because I can not handle the added pressure of a timer. I took my time, and looked up how to implement different fonts and add margins in the CSS beginner's tutorial. I had that page open when I timed myself. Having a reference page gave me a fast way to look up the code I needed, instead of having to memorize everything and accidentally leave code out. This one was the easiest for me, because I found everything I needed and just had to implement colors and style to images. 

### BrowserHistory 3
I tried the same approach to Browser History 3, but could not figure out why my webpage was not loading correctly. After an hour and a half on the shortest WOD for this week, I watched the tutorial. After watching the tutorial, I did it side by side and my code still was not formatting the columns correctly. After 5 attempts I had the code pretty much memorized and understood what each element was doing. I do not recommend watching the tutorials because each person codes differently. I do recommend following the tutorials if you are stuck on a certain part or are having trouble figuring the code out on your own. If you do, make sure you fully understand the code, so you will know what to do next time.
