This is my second class where I am working with Javascript. ICS 314 is more strict about using the Javascript code. I am still used to writing variable declarations in functions. Javascript is so different because you are not just working with console output anymore, you are working with webpages. I learned how to use the different types of variable declarations to keep my code more secure and to help reduce errors. 

I think Javascript is more simple than other programming languages because you do not have to be as specific and it gives you more freedom in writing your code. I think Javascript is a good language for software engineering because it is a simple language that does not get caught up on syntax, but allows you to focus more on the semantics of your project. Also, the CSS files allow your design to be in a separate file and to group your output easily making designs easy to create. 

The practice WODs and Javascript tutorials are very helpful. I had no idea what I was doing when it came to Javascript because it is surprising very different than other programming languages. Javascript is focused on the look of the output, where I feel other programming languages focus on the program running not what the output looks like. With all languages practice is the most important part of learning. Being able to practice in a stress free environment enables for better success in the future. I think being able to practice small WODs on my own with as much time as I need or resources will work for me. I will learn more because I will be able to try to figure it out on my own, but if I get stuck I always have a reference.
