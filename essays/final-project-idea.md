# Project: Grab & Leave
**Collaborators: Hangbo Zhang, Skyler Kimura, Mei Luu** 

## Overview
*The problem*: UH Students/Professors have to wait in long queues at food places (Campus Center/PP/Food Trucks) on campus between classes. 

*The solution*: The Grab & Leave application allows customers to skip the queue by ordering food from UH Manoa food places online. Then, the application will notify the customer when the order is ready, so he/she does not have to wait in line.


## Approach
For this app, present available vendors and their food options that can be ordered ahead of time for pickup. There are two roles: Users, who can login to place an order and Vendors, who can login to specify their food options and pickup times of the day.

Provide an easy to use menu taken from Campus Center, Paradise Palms, and Food Trucks. Organize menus by vendors as well as vendors being able to login and change menu items. 

Some possible Mockup Pages: 
* Landing Page
* Customer Page (place order tap, list of orders they placed)
* Form Page
* Edit Page
* Vendor Home Page

## Use case ideas
* New User goes to landing page, logs in, gets to customer page, places order
* Vendor (as admin) goes to landing page, logs in, goes to edit page, adds new menu items
* User goes to landing page, logs in, places order 

## Beyond the basics
* Sending a notification to the customer's phone when order is ready for pick-up or cancelled due to some reason by the vendor.
* Priority users can be added on the queue first, so their orders are executed first
* Customers can leave reviews for vendor
