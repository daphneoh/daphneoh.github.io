Worked with Adobe photoshop and video editing software. The project was to make a 3-5 minute video answering a personal question. We had full artistic freedom to come up with a presentation. I first recorded a video of my water coloring process which took a little over an hour. I then uploaded the video to Adobe photoshop and figured out how to speed up the video, so it became a time-lapsed version of the original. Then, the fun part. I edited a voiceover of my personal experience and added light background music. The background music I chose to add to the emotion of the video.  

I learned from this project how to create my own artwork from scratch and then add in additional features to make it more intersting. Adobe photoshop was difficult at first to figure out. But once you got the basics it was fun to create a visual representation.
