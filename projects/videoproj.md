summary: Used video editing and art work.
---

Worked with Adobe photoshop and video editing software. The project was to make a 3-5 minute video answering a question. We had full artistic freedom to come up with a presentation. I first recorded a video of my water color, then using Adobe, edited a voiceover and added background music. 

I learned from this project how to create my own artwork from scratch and then add in additional features to make it more intersting.
