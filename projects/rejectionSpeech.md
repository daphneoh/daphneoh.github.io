For this assignment, we had to research a speech topic and present it with a powerpoint as assistance. The requirements were, the speech had to be 5-15 minutes long and contain at least 2 sources that we referenced. We had to practice our speeches at least five times before we could present. Our powerpoint that we had to include had to have at least 3 slides and no words were allowed on any slides to help us. We were allowed to use cards to help us remember. 

I learned from this assignment, how to structure a speech. At the beginning, you want an attention getter, mine was a personal experience. Then introduce the topic you are speaking on, my topic was the fear of being rejected and why we feel that way. Then the main part contains our supporting evidence, sources, stories, or images. We conclude with another story or interesting information and finally our conclusion.
