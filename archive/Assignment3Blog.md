Assignment #3

 Evaluation Guidelines and Class Retrospective BLOG

About the project:

1.         What was accomplished in the project as compared to what was planned?
A lot was accomplished in this project. I was able to create a shopping cart and within the shopping cart add or delete items.
I was also able to validate log in information and email an invoice to customers with their purchase. What was planned was for
personalization on pages after log in. Also, the UI design was supposed to be better and flow better, but that is where I struggle. 

    

2.         Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?
UI design is not the best. And after logging in, it alwasy redirects you to the home page, instead of the page you came from. 
Additional features not implemented would be the use of cookies and counting how many time the user has visited the page. 
Also, personalization of pages for the user. 
 

3.         What was your biggest project risk and how was it managed?
My biggest project risk would be validating log in before giving users access to certain pages. It was managed by a few lines of code,
adding the username to the session and if there was then the user could access the final purchase page. 
 

4.         What is your assessment of the overall quality of the system?
I would say the overall quality is not the best. The design of each page is different, and very plain. The code works, it just does not
look the best. 
 

5.         What is needed before this system can be placed into operation?
Better design. The flow from page to page is choppy and not professional. Going from logging in to the home page everytime can be annoying. 
 

6.         Describe what you are most proud of about this project:
I am most proud of my invoice page and shopping cart. My shopping cart can add and delete quanitities of items and my invoice looks the
best. My invoice is the design I like the most. I am also proud that my project can send you an email with your invoice. 
 

7.         Describe what you are least happy with this project:
I am least happy with the design. I have a hard time implementing html code and .css style that makes webpages look like real webpages. 
That is an area I have a hard time with and need a lot of improvement on. 
 

8.         Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) 
and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and 
your partners contributed (e.g. "I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization"):
I wish I had a partner to work on this with. I would say Dan Port is a possible partner. He helped me write most of my code. 
With the requirements for this assignment, he helped get my code working. If teacher help during office hours don't count as having a partner, 
I did 100% of the assignment.
